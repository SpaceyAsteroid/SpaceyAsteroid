HI HI I'm SpaceyAsteroid but just go by Spacey, Asteroid, or Loser!!

I'm a Loser IRL

I'm Irish (GMT timezone,,, *sweats,,,*) but only speak English. EVERYONE I KNOW IS AMERICAN and im like so far ahead of them.

I'm Polysexual, Polyamorous, and Genderfluid (plus xenogenders)

I created a whole github profile just to tell people about myself on pony.town :D

I use any pronouns!! Mostly just they/it/he + xenos (ask me if you want to know what they are!!)

I use tone indicators!!

I love making friends and whenever I get a friend req I'll almost always accept it so feel free to friend me if you want to ^^

Feel free to ask for my other socials (I have Discord (SpaceySpiral#4384), VRChat, a Nintendo Switch, a Playstation [PS4], ROBLOX, and more,,)

If I'm on PT, I'm usually by my friends. If I'm not, I'm probably looking for more friends / people that like the same things I do,,,

Please don't cover my ponies up!! I like to be seen.

I love talking to people, feel free to whisper me if you wanna talk or just come up to me (except if i'm sleeping i'm afk)

I often space myself out from people when I feel unwanted, rejected, left out, whatever you call it.
